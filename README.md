## Motivation  

> We can at least try to understand our own motives, passions, and prejudices, so as to be conscious of what we are doing when we appeal to those of others.  This is very difficult, because our own prejudice and emotional bias always seems to us so rational.

> -- T. S. Eliot, *To Criticize the Critic*

## Overview  

Racial-bias-detection is a research project on evaluating implicit bias in news media.  We strive to use a data-oriented, functional design with a focus on end-to-end research productivity.

Having just started in late 2020, we are still at an initial stage and formulating our approach. Our hope is to apply NLP/NLU techniques to a corpus of news stories such as criminal news, evaluate possible racial bias in the descriptions and/or framing of the involved parties.
