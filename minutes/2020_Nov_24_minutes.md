# Meeting Minutes

*November 24, 2020*

### Agenda

- Discuss findings
  - [components data set](https://components.one/datasets/all-the-news-2-news-articles-dataset/).
- Discuss current needs
  - Corpus of implicit bias vocabulary
  - Consider creating own corpus over types of events rather than vocabulary, ie: more mentions of aggregate crime rates, undocumented immigration as crime.  The motivation is that news sources may often use these sorts of examples unknowingly or knowingly portraying a group of people a certain way.
- Next steps
