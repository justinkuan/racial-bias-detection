# RESEARCH AGENDA for “Detecting Racial Bias in the News”**

 **Researchers:** Justin Kuan, Jhonsen Djajamuliadi, Bhupesh Kumar, Wen Fung Leong

 **Research Question**

How are crime news from different media sources using racially charged language around the victim’s and perpetrator’s race? 

 

**Discussion Goals**

- Applying machine learning techniques, such as NLP/NLU, to a corpus of crime news stories with the purpose of evaluating how racially charged the descriptions of the victim and perpetrator are.

- Whetting appetites:

- Potential issues we are facing, such as how to set up data, where to collect data, and relevant literature

- Developments we may need to work on. Designing a scoring system for evaluation, mathematically sound evidence-based work.

- Well-defined methodology, scalable and replicable. Research-style approach.

- How do we maximize resource utilization and minimize duplication of resource efforts.

- Maximize resources by having an efficient team-size, reasonable/feasible/practical timeline, and consistently assess and monitor progress.

- Minimizing duplication is about defining roles and fit. 

 

**Research Outputs** 

\1.  End-to-end large project with high transparency and replicable structure

\2.  Easily replicable data duplication process (or just share data)

\3.  Well developed Github

\4.  Front-end product that demonstrates contribution 

\5.  White paper in the form of a Medium post and Github account

 

## Quick Glance Time-Line

| Phase                                                        | Description                                                  | Expected Date |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| **I. Initial  Foray**                                        | Evaluating research question effectiveness and forming initial groundwork. |               |
|                                                              | Exploring data sources and scope of the question, taking time to inspect all the basic elements of the project.  Quick connect on 11/19. | 11/24         |
|                                                              | Select a few sources and start collecting preliminary data   | 12/1          |
| **II.  Data Collection/Clean**                               | Determining how to set up the data and organize it effectively, then collecting and cleaning it.  This section has the most variability in terms of length of work. | TBD           |
| **III.  MVP** -  to be run in conjunction with latter half of II and IV | One or two people run a very basic MVP  to see if there is any traction for our research question within the narrower  data set. Data can be swapped out for  alternative sources if needed.   Potentially use a supervised model since the data set will be much  smaller | TBD           |
| **IV.  Modelling**                                           | Define models to use, whether it is unsupervised or supervised.  Run model, collect results, evaluate, repeat as needed. | TBD           |
| **V.  Development and analysis** – This phase may lead back to IV | Determining a system for ranking articles based on measured racial bias.  Create necessary visualizations to understand data and results better.  Analyzing results and seeing how they fit the general research domain and how they apply to current affairs and policy issues. | TBD           |
| **VI.  Initial Presentation**                                | From team review through formal write-ups, up to the point of getting external review. | TBD           |
| **VII.  Front-end app**                                      | TBD                                                          | TBD           |
