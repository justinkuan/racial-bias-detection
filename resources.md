- [How To Prepare News Articles for Text Summarization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/prepare-news-articles-text-summarization/) - short 5-10 minute read on some basics of text summarization using CNN News Story Dataset (code available) 

- [The Practical Guide to Managing Data Science at Scale](https://www.dominodatalab.com/wp-content/uploads/domino-managing-ds.pdf) - 30-45 minute read on running a DS project to scale.  It is based on Domino Data Lab's DS process, an evolved form of CRISP-DM and akin to Microsoft's TDSP.  I like this one a bit because it's more of a supplemental read, and I have found myself consistently thinking about how many of the pitfalls our team suffered from last year due to lack of clear direction and weak leadership.
