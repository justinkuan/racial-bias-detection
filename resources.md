## Data Sources

- [The GDELT Project](https://www.gdeltproject.org/) - A database of news data from around the world.  Here is an [introduction blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/@atakanguney94/a-brief-introduction-into-gdelt-global-database-of-events-language-and-tone-e96b0c64d03a). 
- [NELA2017 Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ZCXSKG) - This is the dataset created by the authors of the *Sampling the News Producers* article. NEws LAndscape (NELA2017) is hosted on Harvard Dataverse



## Related Work / Literature

#### Similar Studies

- (*blog*) [ML versus the News](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-versus-the-news-3b5b479d8e6a) - Took news articles with the same story and identified their 'neutrality' via sentiment.  This project is of particular note because it hews closely to the idea of our project. 
  - (*academic*) [Technical report](https://github.com/jameslucasbaker/Capstone/raw/master/capstoneReportUPDATED.pdf) - I'm still working my way through this, link auto-downloads file. 	
  - [Github Repository](https://github.com/jameslucasbaker/Capstone) 

- (*academic*) [Sampling the News Producers: A Large News and Feature Data Set for the Study of the Complex Media Landscape](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM18/paper/viewFile/17796/17044) - a paper I found that talks about crafting "a large political news data set, containing over 136K news articles, from 92 news sources, collected over 7 months of 2017."  The data set may be available as well.  This is included as a similar study because if we need to compile our own data source we may end up having to follow the footsteps of this paper.

#### Bias in Machine Learning / NLP

- (*academic*) [Attenuating Bias in Word Vectors](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v89/dev19a/dev19a.pdf) - 2019 conference publication on bias in word vectors.  

- (*blog*) [Man is to Doctor as Woman is to Nurse: the Gender Bias of Word Embeddings](https://towardsdatascience.com/gender-bias-word-embeddings-76d9806a0e17) - TowardsDataScience post about gender inequality in NLP techniques
- (*periodical*) [Machine Bias](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) - ProPublica article about racial bias in ML, this kind of story is part of the inspiration for our topic.

#### Racial bias (and other bias) literature

- (*blog*) [7 Examples of Racial Bias in Job Descriptions](https://blog.ongig.com/diversity-and-inclusion/racial-bias-in-job-descriptions/) - Good introductory piece into how racial language can still be found in modern job descriptions.  Some are low hanging fruit, but clearly they came from somewhere.

  

## Reference guides / miscellaneous

- (*blog*) [How To Prepare News Articles for Text Summarization](https://machinelearningmastery.com/prepare-news-articles-text-summarization/) - short 5-10 minute read on some basics of text summarization using CNN News Story Dataset (code available) 
- (*white paper*) [The Practical Guide to Managing Data Science at Scale](https://www.dominodatalab.com/wp-content/uploads/domino-managing-ds.pdf) - 30-45 minute read on running a DS project to scale.  It is based on Domino Data Lab's DS process, an evolved form of CRISP-DM and akin to Microsoft's TDSP.  I like this one a bit because it's more of a supplemental read, and I have found myself consistently thinking about how many of the pitfalls our team suffered from last year due to lack of clear direction and weak leadership.
