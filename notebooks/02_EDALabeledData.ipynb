Blount was booked for 4th degree assault about 4 hours into 2018. Happy new year! Darlene is engaged to Thomas Markle, Meghan\\'s half-brother. They have the same father, but don\\'t appear to be close anymore. Thomas told the Daily Mail -- which first reported the arrest -- he hasn\\'t seen Meghan since 2011 when she moved to take her role in \"Suits.\" We\\'re guessing this probably hurts Thomas and Darlene\\'s shot at a royal wedding invitation. Just a guess.'"
